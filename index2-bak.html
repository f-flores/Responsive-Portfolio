              <p>
                My name is Francisco Fabian Flores. I was born in Jersey City and raised in Elizabeth, NJ.  In my youth, I practiced Tae Kwon Do and played little league baseball. I also was a volunteer tutor in my community.

                I have always enjoyed programming. In college, I majored in Computer Science. Upon graduation, I worked as computer programmer for a few years at The Prudential and at the University of Wisconsin Madison. Then, I started
                a small cybercafe business, which -from a technical aspect- involved mostly but not only network administration.

                In an effort to learn new technologies and pursue a
                career in software engineering, I recently took it upon myself to join a coding bootcamp and become a web developer. The challenging Rutgers Coding Bootcamp 
                curriculum will surely assist in attaining this goal.
