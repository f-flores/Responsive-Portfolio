        <p>
          My name is Francisco Fabian Flores. I was born in Jersey City and raised in Elizabeth, NJ.  In my youth, I practiced Tae Kwon Do and played little league baseball. I also was a volunteer tutor in my community.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always enjoyed programming. In college, I majored in Computer Science. Upon graduation, I worked as computer programmer for a few years at The Prudential and at the University of Wisconsin Madison. Then, I started
          a small cybercafe business, which -from a technical aspect- involved mostly but not only network administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an effort to learn new technologies and pursue a
          career in software engineering, I recently took it upon myself to join a coding bootcamp and become a web developer. The challenging Rutgers Coding Bootcamp 
          curriculum will surely assist in attaining this goal.
